A sad story.

We, one of my friends and me, decided to develop a new application a year ago (January 2014). The intention was to develop an application to get people's ideas. We came to this idea because of the lack of twitter app. As you know, twitter provides users a good environment to share their ideas but does not provide a way to count how many of users have same idea. 

I already developed first prototype of my application using these technologies; Cassandra and MySQL as database layer, drupal as CMS and Hadoop & Pig for analyse tool.

Our target audence was going to be media companies and famous people such TV channels, radio channels, journalist or goverment officals, artists,....

And my site name was going to be "www.chipingo.com". I owned it since last year.

Today, 24th of October, I am totally disappointed after seeing twitters's new introduction, Twitter Poll.

So, I am releasing all my codes here since it is meaningless from now on. 

Fourtunately, We have another new idea. 

Let's start over.
